Authentication
1. Users might attempt to register with the same info (We enforce different user names)
2. Conection lost while creating new user or hitting back button (Hopefully handled by django)
3. Potential attacks at stealing accout info or brute force break-in attempt (Hopefully handled by django)
4. Wanting to retrieve forgotten account
5. Attempt to access pages without login in (handled by django)

Driver Registration Flow
1. Submit invalid vehicle info
2. Repeated registration of the same vehicle (we banned that based on license plate)
3. Access driver pages with url without registering as driver (We handled that. Users get redirected to driver register page)

2. Ride edited after Driver accepts and before the acceptance info is uploaded to server
